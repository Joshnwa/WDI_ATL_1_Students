#Score Keeper App

Using jQuery, create an app that will perform the individual button operations and display the results within the `<h1 id="result">` tag. The buttons should do the following:

`<button id="zero">` - resets the score to zero

`<button id="add5">` - adds 5 to the score

`<button id="add10">` - add 10 to the score

`<button id="sub1">` - subtract 1 from the score

Be sure to create a seperate .js file and link it to your app at the bottom of the body (along with a jQuery CDN link or minified file link).
