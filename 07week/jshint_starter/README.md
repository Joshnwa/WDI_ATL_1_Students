# jsHint Starter

## Instructions
1. Install jshint via npm:

    $ npm install -g jshint@2.4.4

2. Verify that the starter.js program runs correctly:

    $ node starter.js

   Open starter.js in Sublime and notice that it is written poorly
   (i.e. it is written in bad style and may contain potential problems).

3. Run jshint on the provided JavaScript file:

    $ jshint starter.js

4. Edit starter.js and fix one or more of the warnings.

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no more warnings.

6. Run the program again to verify that it still works correctly.

    $ node starter.js
