# Restaurant Reservations - OOP Analysis and Design

A restaurant has the following tables:

* 4 tables with seating capacity = 4 (2 have a window)
* 1 table with seating capacity = 5
* 2 tables with seating capacity = 6 (1 has a window)
* 1 table with seating capacity = 8

Model a Software App that can manage reservations. You should provide the following features:

* Dinner reservations can be made on the hour and last for 2 hours
* Search for an available time slot
* Return the smallest table that satisfies the request
* Return a nonWindow table unless a window is requested and an available Window table is available
