# 1:1's
We are going to have 1:1 meetings with every student this week just to get to know you guys a little better.

### Some things to think about:

* __Your Background & Goals:__ What is your background coming into the program? Why are you taking this course? What are your goals for the next 3 months? After the course / long-term?

* __Obstacles & Fears:__ What do you think are the situations and circumstances in which you are most likely to stumble, fall, and fail? What keeps you up at night?

* __Habits & Environment:__ What needs to be true for you to produce your best work? What strengths do you already have that you want to leverage during this program?

* __Prework:__ As you were going through your prework and learning more web development, what immediately piqued your interest? Is there anything that you struggled with?
