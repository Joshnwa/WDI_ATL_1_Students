This will be your shared class repo! Cheat sheets, in-class labs and code samples, curated lists of articles, and other resources will live here.

##What's in here?

**Weekly directories** contain in-class code samples and files required for labs and lessons. 

The **cheatsheets** directory will be your go-to for cheat sheets and procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).

The **tangents** folder is where you can find suggestions for extra practice -- ideas, prompts, specs, and more. If you need to polish your skills in a given area, you'll want to start here!

The **resources** directory is where you can find articles, blog posts, tutorials, and more ways to extend your learning or read ahead. 

##What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository. We recommend maintaining a "pristine" local copy (that you can keep pulling from), and a "working" directory (with another name, outside of this directory) that you can copy samples into for in-class exercises and labs.

##How often should I check this repo?

Daily! Instructors will be adding content to this repository every day, so a ```git pull``` in the morning (and after lunch) is a great idea.

Security Guards are here 8AM-10PM. For an emergency or if you need someone to walk with you to your car call (404) 207-0140.
