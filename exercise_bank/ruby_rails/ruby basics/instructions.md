#Zero Week Ruby Lessons

Here are some quick code samples from Zero Week:


##Hello, World

The very first Ruby program! Prints "Hello, world!" to the console.


##Hello, World (Advanced)

Brings a few new topics into our base "Hello, world" app -- standard input/output, variables, upcase, Time.now, conditionals (if/else), string interpolation.

Asks the user's name, age, and whether they've had a birthday yet this year; greets the user and tells them their birth year.


##Barkeep

Conditionals with if/else. Asks the user for their age, then lets them into the bar if they're over 21, or rejects them if they're under 21.
	
##Guess

Cases. Asks the user to choose A, B, C, or D, then outputs a response based on their answer (specific statements for A, B, and C; generic response for all other answers).

##GuessNum
A guess-the-number game that uses loops and conditionals. Sets a random "answer" from 1-10, then prompts user for a guess. When the user guesses correctly, exits; until then, keeps prompting the user for new guesses, and telling them whether their incorrect guess is too high or too low. 

##Multiply Your Life

A times-tables exercise using for loops.
