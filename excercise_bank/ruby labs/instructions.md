##The ATM

Make an ATM! Users should be able to enter commands to check their balance, deposit, and withdraw.

Twist #1: Ask the user for a PIN before they're allowed to enter. (Have a preset PIN or two)

Twist #2: Charge a 5% overdraft fee if the user attempts to withdraw more than their account balance.

##Pick A Card

Take that guessing game next-level -- ask the user to guess a playing card.

Twist #1: Give hints. Tell the user when their card is too high or too low, and if the suit is correct.

Twist #2: Give better hints about the suit -- if they're wrong but have guessed the correct color suit, let them know.

##Spy Names

Ask the user for their name, then give them their name spelled backwards.

Twist #1: Backwards is a good start, but what if we want the name totally scrambled? Mix up the letters in the user's name so it's totally unrecognizable, but has all of the same letters.

Twist #2: Scrambling letters might not be secure enough. It might be safer to swap out their name for a code name, based on the first letter of their first and last names.

##Find and Replace

Count how many occurrences of a given word are in a piece of text.

Twist #1: Replace all instances of a target word with another word (for example, replace "rabbit" with "robot").

Twist #2: Make your replacer case-sensitive and plural-sensitive.
